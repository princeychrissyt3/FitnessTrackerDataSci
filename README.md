FitnessTrackerDataSci is a work-in-progress machine learning project inspired by Dave Ebbelaarâ€™s Coding a Fitness Tracker course. The goal is to process raw fitness tracker data, extract meaningful features, and build models to classify different exercises. Expanding my knowledge and skills in Data Science.
